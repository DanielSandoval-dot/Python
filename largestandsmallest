#5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until
#the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and
#smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number
#catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the
#number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.

largest = None
smallest = None

while True:
    num = input("Enter a number: ")
    if num == "done":
        break

    #num_float = int(num)

    try:
        num_fl = int(num)
    except:
        print("Invalid input")
        continue

    if smallest == None:
        smallest = num_fl
        largest = num_fl


    elif num_fl > largest:
        largest=num_fl

    elif num_fl < smallest:
        smallest=num_fl

    #print(num_fl)
    #print("The smallest is ", smallest)
    #print("The largest is ", largest)


print("Maximum is", largest)
print("Minimum is", smallest)
